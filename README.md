# AI-powered Knowledge Retention System (working title)

## Introduction:

This project tackles the pervasive challenge of knowledge retention in today's information-dense world. Students, professionals, and lifelong learners constantly strive to stay up-to-date in their fields. However, relying solely on reading blogs or learning a topic once often leads to knowledge decay. This project aims to revolutionize the way we retain information by introducing an AI-powered guidance system.

## Problem:

The current learning landscape is plagued by forgetting. We often struggle to recall crucial knowledge when needed, hindering our ability to apply and build upon acquired skills.

## Solution:

This project proposes an innovative AI-powered guidance system designed to combat knowledge loss. It leverages AI techniques to:

- **Extract key points:** Automatically extract the essence of learning materials from various sources (articles, videos, textbooks).
- **Organize learning journeys:** Structure your learning path by categorizing and connecting extracted content based on topics and relationships.
- **Generate questions:** Craft thought-provoking questions at regular intervals to stimulate recall and deepen comprehension.
- **Personalize learning:** Tailor the guidance system to your learning pace and style, maximizing knowledge retention.

## Target Audience:

This system caters to a broad audience, including:

- **Students:** Reinforce classroom learning and enhance their ability to retain academic content.
- **Professionals:** Stay sharp in their fields by solidifying knowledge and readily accessing relevant information.
- **Lifelong learners:** Cultivate a passion for continuous learning and effectively manage their knowledge repository.

## Benefits:

- **Improved Recall:** Foster more effective information retention, empowering you to readily access previously learned concepts.
- **Enhanced Understanding:** Promote deeper comprehension through active learning techniques like self-assessment through generated questions.
- **Personalized Learning:** Tailor the learning experience to your individual needs and preferences.
- **Knowledge Management:** Organize your learning journey, making it easier to revisit and connect different topics.

## Technologies:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text processing and information extraction.
- Machine Learning (ML) for question generation and potentially content recommendation.
- Knowledge Representation techniques to structure extracted knowledge.
- Web scraping or APIs to access learning materials from various sources (optional).
- Chatbot integration (optional) to enable interactive questioning and knowledge access.

## Project Status:

This project is currently under development.

## Next Steps:

- Implement key functionalities such as content extraction, question generation, and personalized learning paths.
- Design user interfaces for seamless interaction and user experience.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the system through user testing and feedback loops.
